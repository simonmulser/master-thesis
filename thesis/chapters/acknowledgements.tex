First, I would like to sincerely thank my parents Theresia Jud Mulser and Josef Mulser for their ongoing support throughout my whole education. Without their trust in and my abilities, I would have never had the opportunity to reach this goal in my academic career. Furthermore, I would like to thank my girlfriend Julia for her tireless motivation during critical phases and for reviewing the present work.

Special thanks go to Internet Foundation Austria for granting me a scholarship for this thesis. With the scholarship, I had the possibility to invest more time and resources in the thesis. Additionally, I could extend the implemented simulation software for a more general purpose and provide it as a stand-alone framework to foster more investigation and development in the research area.

Finally, I would like to thank Privatdoz. Mag.rer.soc.oec. Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Edgar Weippl and Univ.Lektor Dipl.-Ing. Aljosha Judmayer for the possibility of conducting this master thesis as well as their supervision and their constructive feedback.
