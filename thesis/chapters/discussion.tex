relative gain but only if the share is really high

\section{relative gain}

selfish mining is working
but only relative gain
wait for difficulty adjustment
what would happen to the price
what would happen if somebody notices that someone is selfish mining
combination with other attacks

\section{performance}

current simulation not performing that good because in case of match lambda is small
extra hop
selfish proxy needs to do some processing
other nodes are all connected and have low latency
using compact blocks
